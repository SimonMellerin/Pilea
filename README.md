# Pilea - A little dashboard to analyse your electricity consumption data from Linky

### *Work in progress*

The idea of Pilea is to display electricity consumption and weather data on a little dashboard that allow the user to:

* Better understand is consumption of electricity
* Analyse his electricity consumption throw weather data (in a first time, essentialy temperature)

Data are daily collected, we get:

* Electricity consumption data from your Linky via Enedis API (with [php-LnkyAPI](https://github.com/KiboOst/php-LinkyAPI)
*  Weather observation data from [Meteo France INSPIRE API](https://donneespubliques.meteofrance.fr/client/gfx/utilisateur/File/documentation-webservices-inspire.pdf)


### Interface

*  A dashboard with several graphics, maybe 2 tabs :
	*  General consumption graphics
	*  Meteo (TÂ°) and energy consumption
*  A configuration panel with 2 tabs (or to area)
	*  One to create data income (linky sensor or Meteo France feed)
	*  One to link Linky sensor with Meteo France feed
